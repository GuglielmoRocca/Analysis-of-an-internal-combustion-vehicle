# Analysis-of-an-internal-combustion-vehicle
In this project, an in-depth study was carried out on the limiting cycle of internal combustion engines, the combustion process using the Benson model, heat release, and particulate emissions. Furthermore, the project includes a study on a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV).  
A Simulink model was developed to simulate the behavior of an internal combustion engine under a generic driving cycle. This model allows the calculation of the vehicleâ€™s fuel consumption, enabling a comparison with the same vehicle converted to a hybrid configuration.
